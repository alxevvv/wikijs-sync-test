# Subpages
I created a set of pages with a simple nesting structure to test things related to generating a navigation.

## Header navigation
Created from a set of pages that have a first-level URL.

## Sidebar navigation
Contains navigation through the sublevels of the current level. The sidebar creation algorithm is quite simple now, so further nesting currently isn't supported. I think a more complex navigation structure can be implemented too, if it's necessary.
